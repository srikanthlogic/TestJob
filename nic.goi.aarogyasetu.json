I need to register myself for vaccination and this stupid application doesn't want to work. Already tried uninstalling and reinstalling it but no go. Fix the issue and get me vaccinated please!","I installed this app 2 months back and registered with my mobile number successfully no issue in that and I uninstalled. But the problem is I reinstalled today and it shows some error and there is some error logging you. It's Okay then what I did uninstalled and reinstalled again and again but no use. Am facing this problem from morning. I want vaccinated.","The app is very helpful and easy to use for providing covid awareness and registering for vaccination. But sometimes I wouldn't be able to access the app due to \"403 Forbidden\" error message appearing on the home page. Sometimes when I try to re-login, I would get error message on submitting my phone number. Edit: I'm able to resolve this issue by turning off VPN on my phone","It should have corona positive update of last 24 hrs and not 28 days. It should also beep or alert message if near a containment zone or covid patient. it includes all the symptoms of corona and not just 3-4 default ones. There was no update after my review in 2020. This application is of no use except to show your status as and when asked for.","I installed the app yesterday and after few hours when I opened the app it shows errors. I checked it again today and found the same error window. So I uninstalled and then reinstalled it now. But while trying to login with my mobile number it shows \" there is some error logging you in\". Is this because I registered with the same mobile number yesterday? Then how can I retain my old account? Or how can I solve this problem?
