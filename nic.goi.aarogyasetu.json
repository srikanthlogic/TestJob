But sometimes I wouldn't be able to access the app due to \"403 Forbidden\" error message appearing on the home page. Sometimes when I try to re-login, I would get error message on submitting my phone number. Edit: I'm able to resolve this issue by turning off VPN on my phone","Had high hopes, but didn't work in tandem with government database. If a registered user falls ill with covid his phones should be notified and should alert all nearby users, but didn't do any of it. It relys on the honesty of the people to feed the information to the app. And we all know how honest people are, or would care less.","I installed the app yesterday and after few hours when I opened the app it shows errors. I checked it again today and found the same error window. So I uninstalled and then reinstalled it now. But while trying to login with my mobile number it shows \" there is some error logging you in\". Is this because I registered with the same mobile number yesterday? Then how can I retain my old account? Or how can I solve this problem? Seeking your attention to this problem.","Useless App! My wife got vaccinated using my phone number on April, and till now, her certificate isn't there! Plus every time I mistakenly touch the back button, I'm asked to give my phone number and then OTP! It's frustrating ðŸ˜¤! Information isn't well grouped. Or needs to keep searching here and there for what he needs. Total waste of time. UI Design is ugly. The auto scroll on home page forces user to wait for the desired information. Wish I could give a negative rating!!","Very nice app, and integration with other covid services is a nice move. I have a suggestion: design a 'home mode' in which user can switch off bluetooth and location when mode is selected. Whenever I come back home, I have to force stop the app, because the warning notification won't go away on switching off bluetooth and location, but keeping them on without any use drains battery."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"nic.goi.aarogyasetu","url":"http://gplayapi.herokuapp.com/api/apps/nic.goi.aarogyasetu","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nic.goi.aarogyasetu&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://gplayapi.herokuapp.com/api/apps/nic.goi.aarogyasetu/permissions","similar":"http://gplayapi.herokuapp.com/api/apps/nic.goi.aarogyasetu/similar"}
